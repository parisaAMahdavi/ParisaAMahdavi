### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Machine Learning Developer** with a master's in **Electrical Engineering** and over three years of expertise in developing advanced deep learning models, particularly focusing on cutting-edge architectures in NLP for text data. I specialize in designing end-to-end ML pipelines, from initial data cleaning, and preprocessing to model deployment efficiently using Azure and Docker for scalability. I also have hands-on experience working with Pytorch, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Tensorflow.

I'm also passionate about **merging ML algorithms with embedded systems** to run them on edge devices efficiently.

<!-- ðŸ”­ A summary of the work I've done so far

* During my professional journey as a Machine Learning Developer at Done Co, I successfully fine-tuned a cutting-edge transformer model (Bert) for intent detection and slot-filling tasks in NLP with more than 90% accuracy for a virtual voice assistant, collaborating with ML engineers to deploy the model into production. In this position, I also gained valuable experience working in an agile environment and developed skills in cross-team collaboration.

* During my master's in the field of electrical engineering with a focus on neural networks, work on optimizing a CNN model architecture(LeNet) specifically improving its overall performance while implementing on Xilinx FPGAs. My main objectives were to speed up inference time using advanced acceleration methods such as applying approximate multipliers and quantization within convolution layers. I've successfully implemented these techniques into the CNN model and achieved a 50% reduction in runtime

* As an electrical intern at Madar Tarah Co, I gained practical experience in both soft and hard skills at an industrial level. I actively contributed to the design of industrial boards with high-performance processors, while also supporting the verification of component symbols and footprints to ensure alignment with reference designs, utilizing Altium. -->

* I am currently exploring new opportunities in Machine Learning and Data Science to further advance my journey in these domains.
